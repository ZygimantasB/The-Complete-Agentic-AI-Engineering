([itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/salesforce-just-launched-a-new-catch-all-platform-to-build-enterprise-ai-agents?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models for any AI agent, supporting integration with existing agents with minimal code modifications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source agents. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **AutoAgent**: A fully-automated, zero-code framework that allows users to create and deploy large language model agents through natural language alone, serving as a versatile multi-agent system for general AI assistants. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: AWS's platform designed to simplify the development and deployment of advanced AI agents, including features like AgentCore Runtime for scalable serverless deployment and AgentCore Memory for context management. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/aws-looks-to-super-charge-ai-agents-with-amazon-bedrock-agentcore?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard introduced by Anthropic to standardize the integration and sharing of data between AI systems and external tools, adopted by major AI providers including OpenAI and Google DeepMind. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Kruti**: A multilingual AI agent developed by Ola Krutrim, designed to perform real-world tasks for users, such as booking taxis and ordering food, by integrating directly with various online services. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruti?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Manus**: An autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and autonomous decision-making. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_%28AI_agent%29?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese frameworks reflect the rapid advancements in AI agent development, offering diverse tools and platforms for creating intelligent, autonomous systems.
