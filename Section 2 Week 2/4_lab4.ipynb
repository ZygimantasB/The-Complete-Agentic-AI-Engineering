      "text/markdown": "As of October 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities:\n\n- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing integration with various agents with minimal code modifications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes LLMs and mathematical frameworks to design adaptive AI agents for complex environments. PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through combinatorial spaces, supporting scalable and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework democratizing the development of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and enhancing agent robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source agents. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: A lightweight Python framework released in March 2025, designed for creating multi-agent workflows with comprehensive tracing and guardrails. It is provider-agnostic, compatible with over 100 different LLMs. ([jlcnews.com](https://www.jlcnews.com/post/the-best-ai-agents-in-2025-tools-frameworks-and-platforms-compared?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: Announced in April 2025, this modular framework integrates with Google's ecosystem, including Gemini and Vertex AI. It supports hierarchical agent compositions and requires minimal code for efficient development. ([jlcnews.com](https://www.jlcnews.com/post/the-best-ai-agents-in-2025-tools-frameworks-and-platforms-compared?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: Unveiled in August 2025, this platform simplifies the development and deployment of advanced AI agents. It includes modular services supporting the full production lifecycle, emphasizing flexibility and scalability. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/aws-looks-to-super-charge-ai-agents-with-amazon-bedrock-agentcore?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP is an open-source standard for integrating AI systems with external tools and data sources. It has been adopted by major AI providers, including OpenAI and Google DeepMind. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Kruti**: A multilingual AI agent developed by Ola Krutrim, released in June 2025. It performs real-world tasks by integrating with various online services and supports multiple Indian languages. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruti?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese frameworks reflect the rapid advancements in AI agent development, offering diverse tools for creating intelligent, adaptable, and collaborative systems.
